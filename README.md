>Objective 1

>>This develops the first building block for the MIPS datapath, the ALU. The MIPS
is a 32-bit RISC CPU designed by one of the textbook authors. It is still manufactured,
and licensed as a synthesizable core that can be embedded in other chips. This
ALU will be combined with the other data path components.
    
>Objective 2

>>This develops the remaining data path building blocks for the MIPS processor. 
It will be combined with the MIPS controller in future productions.
VHDL for the following MIPS components. Tested each entity by
developing simulation files for the entity. Implementation of the
functionality described for each entity. To make the simulation results
more readable, we will use a 32-bit data-path (both addr and data buses).
